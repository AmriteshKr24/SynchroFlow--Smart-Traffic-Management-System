# SynchroFlow--Smart-Traffic-Management-System

SynchroFlow is Smart Traffic Management System model using vehicle recognition and counting using YOLO algorithm to efficiently manage traffic flow.

This project uses cameras at traffic intersections to take live pictures and measure how crowded the roads are. 

By using YOLO object detection, it determines the number of cars and adjusts the traffic signal timings to manage the flow of vehicles. This helps to reduce traffic jams, makes commuting faster, and lowers fuel use. 

To showcase how it works, the project uses Pygame to create a simple simulation showing the system in action.

This approach aims to reduce traffic congestion and improve the flow of road transport within the city.
